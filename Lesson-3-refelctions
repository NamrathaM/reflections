When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

use one instead of another?

Generally branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Easy retrieval or backtracking.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

GitHub.

master?  What benefits does each approach have?
